# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Model
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning system for detecting credit card fraud on a highly imbalanced dataset (~2.7M transactions). The system focuses on minimizing false negatives while maintaining strong overall predictive performance.. Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC
